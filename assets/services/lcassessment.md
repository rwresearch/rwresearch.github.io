# Life Cycle Assessment Services

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a complete method of measuring environmental impacts of a product's life cycle (sometimes also called cradle-to-grave analysis). LCAs can  be used to focus on energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, or waste generation, or can include a combination of some or all of these areas. LCAs assess potential impact by:

- Organizing into lists relevant inputs and outputs
- Evaluating the environmental effects caused by the inputs and outputs
- Interpreting the results of the inventory
- Evaluating the impact and offering suggestions for reducing such impacts

### Inquiries
