# Literature Review Services

The literature review is a complex summary of other theories, experiments, and ideas of highly experienced professionals. Also, the literature review is a key step in comparing and contrasting novel theories and ideas, as well in providing a compelling and thoroughly researched argument you may need to support new technology R&D, capital investment expenditures, legal disputes, and policy development and implementation.   

Random Walk Research provides the following literature review services: 

- Systematic review -- service for detecting, picking out & evaluating all applicable studies and examining important research data
- Long form annotated bibliographies -- containing additional elements not commonly present in annotations, including the audience, relevance to the subject topic, and assessment of the authority of the author
- URL links to primary source files that are uncovered during the literature review
- Summary of literature review results, highlighting key theories and talking points to support (or refute) arguments needed in your final decision
